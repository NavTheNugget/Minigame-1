# Colliders - Minigame
Colliders is basically a catch the object style minigame with a timer, scoreboard and very basic menu and finishing screen, the game has a sixty second clock which and uses pixel font for its UI.

The UI resembles command line games, but this game runs on an SDL2_Window and Renders all the objects using colors, the random generation algorithm is simple and is not too hard to understand, the game is written in just one source file called: "main.cpp" and uses Makefile to compile its source, the game uses SDL2, SDL2_IMAGE AND SDL2_TTF for its core and C++ as its programming language. The game uses G++ Compiler and for now runs on Mac.

### Conclusion
This project marks my first completed C++ Game and First Completed Mac Game, This Game is basically designed just for me, since I am get bored coding throughout the day, this is just a simple stress reliever, I started working on this project yesterday and got so hyped I finished it in a day.
